title: Urban Interaction
slug: urban-interaction

This category examines cities as interactive systems shaped by data, media, and human participation.

Rather than treating urban space as a static backdrop, these projects explore how interaction, sensing, and narrative can mediate relationships between people, infrastructure, and place. Through critical media, participatory systems, and speculative storytelling, the work reflects on how urban experiences are produced, negotiated, and contested in contemporary cities.
