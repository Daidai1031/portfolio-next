title: Computational Interaction
slug: hci
---

My HCI projects explore interaction as an embodied and systemic experience rather than a screen-based interface.

These works investigate how people understand, negotiate, and co-create with computational systems through data-driven interaction, human–machine collaboration, and physical feedback loops. By situating computation within tangible artifacts and spatial contexts, the projects examine how interaction design can shape perception, agency, and collective behavior.
