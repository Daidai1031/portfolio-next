My fabrication projects focus on the relationship between material behavior, computational logic, and construction processes.

Through parametric design, custom components, and hands-on prototyping, these works explore how digital fabrication can enhance precision, adaptability, and structural intelligence—particularly when working with variable or hybrid materials. The projects emphasize making as a form of inquiry, where design decisions emerge through iterative negotiation between code, material, and assembly.
