This category presents architectural projects that focus on spatial organization, environmental experience, and social use.

The works explore how form, circulation, and material strategies shape everyday interactions within buildings and public spaces. While grounded in architectural design, these projects provide the spatial and conceptual foundation for my later explorations in interaction, systems, and urban-scale thinking.
