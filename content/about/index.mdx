## Designing Interactive Systems Across Space, Technology, and Urban Life

I design interactive systems that operate across physical space, digital technology, and urban life.

My work sits at the intersection of HCI, urban interaction, and digital fabrication, focusing on how people experience, navigate, and participate in environments—from small-scale interactive installations to data-informed public spaces and urban systems.

I approach design as a process of sensing, prototyping, and iteration. Through physical computing, spatial design, and data-driven methods, I explore how environments can respond to human behavior and, in turn, shape social interaction.

My background in architecture and urban design provides a strong spatial foundation for my work. Over time, my practice has expanded toward interaction design and emerging technologies, allowing me to work fluidly across scales.

I see design not as a finished object, but as an evolving relationship between people, space, and systems.
